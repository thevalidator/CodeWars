Variation of nice kata Bits Battle, the war has expanded and become dirtier and meaner; both even and odd numbers will fight with their pointy 1s. And negative integers are coming into play as well, with, Ã§a va sans dire, a negative contribution (think of them as spies or saboteurs).

Again, three possible outcomes: odds win, evens win and tie.

Examples:

bitsWar(new int[]{1,5,12}).equals("odds win") == true   // 1+101 vs 1100, 3 vs 2
bitsWar(new int[]{7,-3,20}).equals("evens win") == true // 111-11 vs 10100, 3-2 vs 2
bitsWar(new int[]{7,-3,-2,6}).equals("tie") == true     // 111-11 vs -1+110, 3-2 vs -1+2
